Tutorial Oxygine 2D game framework project

In order to build application you need to create a project corresponding to your platform via gen_template tool provided by Oxygine.
It is recommended to create it in the directory with name proj.<your platform> (e.g. proj.win32 pr proj.cmake) inside this one.
You should also provide required libraries, i.e. SDL2 and others to run the app (you can just copy .dll files from any of Oxygine example projects if you are using Visual Studio).
